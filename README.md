# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
In this challenge, I worked on a content card component that showcases various elements such as an image, title, description, category tag, publication date, and author information. This component is perfect for displaying articles, blog posts, or any other type of similar content.
